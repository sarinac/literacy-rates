            <!-- Introduction -->
            <div id="introduction">
                <h2>What is literacy rate?</h2>
                <p>Literacy Rate measures the percent of the population that can read and write statements that are commonly used in everyday life. UNESCO segments this metric by age group (youth, adult, elderly) and gender because these groups receive different qualities of education, which is influenced by factors such as the cultural standards for genders, demographic changes, and economic stability. For example, war and instability would leave some countries in poverty, and education would not be easily accessible. Historically, many cultures have favored men, granting them easier access to learning and then employment. Technology has also been growing rapidly, influencing how quickly the younger generation gains information.</p>
                <p>This report summarizes the growth of literacy rates from 2010 to 2020, focusing particularly on female adults (ages 15 and up), their literacy rates split by countries and their gender gap in education.</p>

                <h2>How has the regional female literacy rate improved in the past decade?</h2>
                <p>The chart below compares the 6 main regions provided by The World Bank of Data (North America has no data and is excluded). The regions are hills ordered from left to right using the 2020 female literacy rate, which is the height.</p>

                        <p><span class="p0-color bold">Sub-Saharan Africa</span> has the lowest female literacy rate, starting from 50% in 2010 but increasing the most rapidly by an overall 11% over the past 10 years. On the other side of the spectrum, <span class="p5-color bold">Europe & Central Asia</span>, which mostly consists of higher income and developed countries, started at a 97% female literacy rate in 2010, increasing only by an overall 1% to 98% over the past 10 years.</p>
                        <p>The past decade has shown that all regions have been improving literacy rates, yet regions with more room to grow are improving much faster than regions that already have a higher literacy rate.</p>

                <p>The next deep-dive takes a look at the country composition of the 6 regions. Not all countries improve their education quality at the same rate, and there must be some countries that have a higher economic standing than others in close proximity.

Their position shows the country's historical female literacy rate and gender gap. Generally, they show progress towards improving the literacy rate and closing the gender gap.

The link to the dataset is <a href="https://wdvp.worldgovernmentsummit.org/">here</a>. The <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.ADT.LITR.FE.ZS?view=chart">female literacy rates</a> and <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.ADT.LITR.MA.ZS?view=chart">male literacy rates</a> are available from the World Bank. The data used includes the country, its region, its income group, and its literacy rates for female and male between 2010 and 2020.</p>
                <p>The <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/literacy-rate">UNESCO glossary</a> provided the definition of literacy rate, its indication on the quality of education systems, and some external factors.</p>
                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <p>
                    This dataset had to be explored, analyzed, and curated before creating a data visualization. Some countries had sparse data, some were missing entirely, the data points were too cluttered, etc.. Therefore, the following rules were applied to curate the dataset systematically.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Countries that did not have more than 2 years of data were dropped because their growth rates could not be computed.</li>
                    <li>Only absolute growth rates were plotted if they had data on or after 2015. Using data before 2015 would have a higher chance of being outdated, thus not accurately comparable to the other countries with more up-to-date data.</li>
                    <li>Multiple versions of aggregated regions were provided in the original dataset, but they weren't used unless the individual countries were explicitly mapped to the region. This was to avoid using regions that overlapped countries and avoid making mistakes on using an incorrect mapping if my source was outdated. Therefore, many aggregations, such as Caribbean small states or European Union, were not used in the visualization. The North America region was dropped due to not having any countries with literacy rate information.</li>
                    <li>Power scales were used instead of linear scales to map the female literacy rates (x-axis) and gender gap in literacy rates (y-axis). Transforming helped reduce cluttering and zoom into the countries where the female literacy rates were close to 100% and gender gap close to 0%.</li>
                    <li>Countries with a gender gap with female literacy rate more than 5% more than the male literacy rate in their latest year were dropped due to being outliers. Lesotho (Sub-Saharan Africa) and Jamaica (Latin America & Caribbean) were removed due to having a -17.2% and -9.3% gap, respectively.</li>
                    <li>Crumbs (small translucent shapes) were plotted only if the country had at least 8 years of data. Filtering to only a few countries' paths made it easier to tell apart from one another.</li>
                </ul>
